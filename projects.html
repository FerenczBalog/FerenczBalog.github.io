                        Let's call it "Life Tracker" or "Lifestyle Dashboard." 
                        Mylifedash aims to simplify users' lives by tracking their lifestyle. 
                        The website functions as a comprehensive dashboard, providing a range of 
                        features including financial statements, career and personal life 
                        achievement tracking, and a chill zone for relaxation. While the current 
                        version of the website offers only a fraction of its intended functionality, 
                        it does provide a three-day weather forecast obtained from an API. The weather 
                        information includes selected details, but it is important to note that, based 
                        on tests and observations, there is a 15% margin of error. In future versions, 
                        this margin of error will be addressed and the design will be simplified.

                <h4>Technical overview</h4>

                <p>
                    The initial version of the website was developed using HTML, CSS, 
                    and JavaScript as the core programming languages. The main functionality 
                    of fetching weather forecasts was implemented through API integration. 
                    To enhance the user experience and mimic an application-like behavior, 
                    the web application utilized separate HTML pages for each function while 
                    maintaining a unified styling and JavaScript page for the entire project. 
                    This approach allowed for code reusability and adhered to the principles 
                    of clean code by promoting modularization and organization. By writing 
                    the code once and leveraging it across multiple functions, the development 
                    process was optimized, reducing redundancy and enhancing maintainability. 
                    The use of consistent styling and JavaScript code throughout the website 
                    ensured a cohesive and unified user interface.                    

                        <div class="grid">
                            <img src="media/mylifedash/3.png" style="margin: auto;">
                            <p>
                                As a stylistic principle, the project employed shorthand lines for code 
                                efficiency. Default classes such as "fullscreen," "layout," or "border settings" 
                                were defined at the top of the file, allowing for consistent application across 
                                various elements. This approach facilitated quick and consistent styling without 
                                excessive repetition. For the layout, the project utilized the flexbox model for the header 
                                and grid layout for sections like the weather forecast section. Flexbox 
                                provided flexibility in positioning and aligning elements within the header, 
                                while grid layout enabled a structured presentation of content within the 
                                weather forecast section. Initially, a slideshow was planned for the hourly forecast, but to streamline 
                                the development process and minimize the amount of JavaScript code required, 
                                the decision was made to leverage the CSS overflow property. By applying the 
                                appropriate overflow settings, the desired behavior for the hourly forecast 
                                section could be achieved without the need for extensive JavaScript implementation.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                    By employing shorthand lines, specifying default classes, and utilizing 
                    layout technologies such as flexbox and grid layout, the project achieved 
                    efficient and responsive styling. The decision to use CSS overflow instead 
                    of building a slideshow with JavaScript helped reduce complexity and code 
                    overhead, resulting in a more streamlined development approach.
                    <br><br>
                    In this project, the JavaScript file is designed with a focus on efficiency 
                    and clean code principles. Approximately 80% of the JavaScript code is 
                    dedicated to handling the weather forecast functionality, while the 
                    remaining 20% encompasses functions responsible for the modal, clock, 
                    Welcome text (based on the time slot), and the display of the month and 
                    days from the "new Date" constructor.
                    

                    <div class="grid">
                        <p>To enhance code clarity and maintainability, variables are consistently declared using 
                            the const keyword to ensure their immutability. This approach helps avoid accidental 
                            reassignments and promotes better code reliability. Furthermore, adhering to clean code 
                            principles, all variables are declared at the top of the file, thoughtfully organized 
                            under descriptive comments that explain their purpose. For instance, variables related 
                            to the clock function are grouped between two "// CLOCK" comments, facilitating easy 
                            reference for developers working on the project.
                            <br>
                            By following this approach, the project promotes code reusability, readability, 
                            and maintainability. The decision to keep variable names constant and logically 
                            organized reduces the likelihood of naming conflicts and streamlines the development 
                            process. The combination of efficient JavaScript usage, adherence to clean code 
                            practices, and focus on essential functionalities ensures that the web application 
                            performs optimally and delivers a seamless user experience.

                <h4>Next steps</h4>

                <p>
                    In the coming months, I am enthusiastic about undertaking a complete rewrite 
                    of the project's frontend using ReactJS. This revamp will encompass introducing 
                    new features and an enhanced design, with the overarching goal of elevating the 
                    website's quality and user experience.
                    <br>
                    To ensure scalability and flexibility, I plan to adopt a non-relational 
                    database like Atlas as the backend database solution. This choice will 
                    enable efficient handling of data and facilitate seamless integration with ReactJS.
                    <br>
                    By leveraging the power of ReactJS and implementing an advanced database 
                    solution, I am committed to delivering a more robust, responsive, and 
                    user-friendly website. This ambitious overhaul aims to elevate the overall 
                    quality and usability of the platform, providing users with a more enjoyable 
                    and intuitive experience.
